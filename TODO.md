# Kulworks — To-Do

Working list for launch + the custom backend build. Grouped by theme, not strict order.
For how the whole system fits together, see **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

---

## ▶️ Resume here (pick up on any machine / next session)

**Status:** Full custom backend is **built and shipped to production**, running behind the
coming-soon gate (`constructionMode: true`). See the ✅ items below for everything done.

**Roadmap order (Sam, 2026-07-03):** (1) 2FA method choice app-or-email ✅ SHIPPED →
(2) #10 Quotes & Invoices (Venmo + PayPal) ✅ SHIPPED → (3) Newsletter v2 →
(4) Google Calendar ✅ SHIPPED + LIVE (OAuth setup done 2026-07-15) →
(5) **Real site content + photos** (copy, portfolio/service images) ← *next* → then flip
construction mode off to launch.

**Next up:** **Real site content + photos** (roadmap #5) — copy proofread, portfolio/service
images, address/socials in `site.ts`. Newsletter v2 (#11) remains available if preferred.
Remaining non-code launch work is tracked in "Beyond code — business/ops gaps" below.

**Google Calendar — setup complete (2026-07-15).** OAuth app published to Production (so
refresh tokens don't expire), Calendar API enabled, `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN` + `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID`
set in `.env.local` + Vercel. Verified live via `npm run e2e` (26/26). Project dates + reminders
now sync automatically to the "Kulworks" calendar. (If ever re-doing on a new Google project:
`npm run google:auth` → `npm run google:calendar` → set both env vars → `npm run calendar:backfill`.)

**To run locally on a fresh clone:**
1. `npm install`
2. **GET THE SECRETS.** ⬇️ If a new PC complains it's *"missing environment variables"* or
   *"can't find `.env.local`"* — THIS is the fix. `.env.local` is gitignored on purpose
   (it holds all the API keys/passwords), so it does NOT come with `git clone`. Do **NOT**
   copy it around by email/Drive/USB. Instead pull it straight from Vercel — run these
   four commands in the project folder, in order:
   ```
   npm i -g vercel
   vercel login
   vercel link                                    # choose the "kulworks" project
   vercel env pull .env.local --environment=production
   ```
   That creates `.env.local` with every real secret. (Fallback only if Vercel is
   unavailable: copy `.env.example` → `.env.local` and fill each value from the Vercel
   dashboard → Project → Settings → Environment Variables.)
3. `npm run dev` → http://localhost:3002  (admin: `/admin/login/`)

Everything (database, email, Drive) is cloud-hosted + env-driven, so a second machine
connects to the **same live data** automatically. Migrations are already applied (they're
in `prisma/migrations/`). Handy: `npm run db:studio` (browse DB), `npm run db:seed`,
`node scripts/smoke-test.mjs` (with dev server up).

**Deploy:** push to `main` → Vercel auto-deploys production. Keep `constructionMode: true`
until the real launch (then flip to `false` after content/socials/address are ready).

---

## 🚀 Launch blockers (before the site goes fully public)

These are empty placeholders in [src/data/site.ts](src/data/site.ts) and elsewhere that
should be filled with real info before launch:

- [ ] **Street address** — `site.ts:40` (only if you have a public storefront)
- [ ] **Postal code** — `site.ts:43`
- [ ] **Mailing address / PO box** — Sam doesn't have one yet. Required in marketing-email
      footers (CAN-SPAM) before sending real newsletters; get a PO box, then add to site data.
- [ ] **Social handles** — `site.ts:59`, still `REPLACE_WITH_HANDLE` placeholders
- [ ] **PayPal.me handle** — `site.ts`, still `REPLACE_WITH_PAYPAL_ME_HANDLE` (Venmo + Zelle set)
- [ ] **Proofread every page** in Sam's voice.
- [~] **Real photos** — MANY DONE (2026-07-21, via a sibling session: 15 WebP images wired into
      portfolio, services, home carousel, about portrait, and 3 card sub-pages). Remaining slots
      still on labeled placeholders — see the shot-list below.
- [x] **OG share image** — DONE. Branded `public/images/og-default.png` (1200×630) generated
      (`npm run og`, `scripts/make-og.mjs`). Swap for real art anytime by replacing the file.
- [x] **On-page SEO polish (2026-07-15)** — added a real `<h1>` to every page (was `<h2>`
      via SectionHeading — fixed with an `as` prop); expanded `areaServed` schema to San
      Antonio + Hill Country towns (Bulverde, Blanco, Spring Branch, etc.); added a nationwide-
      shipping note (footer + Contact "Where we work"). Kept visible copy lean — town list
      lives in structured data, not on-page keyword lists.
- [x] **2FA on admin login (authenticator app)** — BUILT + shipped (free, Supabase TOTP).
      Enroll on Team page, enforced 6-digit code at login, middleware enforces for enrolled
      users. No-factor accounts unaffected. **Recovery if locked out:** Supabase dashboard →
      Authentication → the user → remove the MFA factor (re-enables password-only login).
- [x] **2FA method choice: app OR emailed code** — SHIPPED. Per-admin master switch
      (`Profile.twoFactorEnabled`); at login the admin chooses authenticator app (Supabase
      TOTP) or a 6-digit code emailed via Resend. Email path is custom: `TwoFactorCode`
      (hashed + 10-min expiry + 5-try cap) + HMAC-signed `kw2fa` cookie (12h), enforced in
      `requireProfile`; cleared on logout/idle. FINAL: only email + app (no SMS — the free
      carrier email-to-SMS gateway is best-effort, unsafe for login codes). **Recovery if
      locked out:** Supabase dashboard → Auth → user → remove MFA factor, and/or set
      `Profile.twoFactorEnabled = false`.
- [x] **Admin phone field** — Profile.phone, required on create, editable; for records.
- [x] **LAUNCHED (2026-07-23)** — `constructionMode: false`; the real home page is now the
      public main page and the site is indexable. `ComingSoon.tsx` kept in the repo (not
      deleted), just no longer rendered. Went live "with what we can" — the items below
      (socials, PayPal, postal code, tarot/giant + who-it's-for photos, proofread) are
      post-launch polish, not blockers.

### 📸 Remaining photos — shot-list (fill these placeholder slots)

Spec (image optimization is OFF): final-compressed **WebP**; **4:3 ~1200×900** for
portfolio/service/about/card-page slots, **3:2 ~1200×800** for the home studio carousel.
Drop the file in the matching `public/images/...` folder and set the `src`/`image` string.
Alternates for some of these are in `D:\Kulworks\Raw Footage\Website Selects\`.

- [x] **Filament / FDM** — DONE 2026-07-22 (Custom Prop Print → armor; FDM service → city
      upgrades). Replacement Components + City Upgrade Pieces items were removed → folded into
      the portfolio "we also make…" note.
- [x] **Design / 3D modeling** — DONE 2026-07-22 (3D Model Showcase → animated Shapr3D model;
      Tile Artwork Prep → Inkarnate; boxes-and-upgrades → Shapr3D CAD box insert).
- [x] **tarot + giant card pages** — HIDDEN 2026-07-23 (no photos). `hidden: true` on those
      cardCluster entries → filtered from the hub accordion + sitemap + noindex, but the pages
      still build (restore by removing the flag). Offered on custom order via text on the
      card-printing hub + the portfolio "just ask" note. Kept in the calculator (already there).
      Only add photos if/when reviving the dedicated pages.
- [ ] **"Who it's for" thumbnails (12)** — Sam wants a small picture for EACH audience card
      instead of the emoji icon. Items: Sports Teams, Schools & Clubs, Game & Card Designers,
      Designer Prototypes, Our Own Games, Wedding Venues, Work Parties, Events & Celebrations,
      Photographers, Local Activities & Market Sellers, Game Stores, Convention Attendees.
      Small square works best (1:1, ~600×600 WebP). Needs a code change too: add an optional
      `image?` to the `Audience` type (`src/data/audiences.ts`) and have `AudienceCard` render
      it in place of the icon when set (shown on home + `/who-its-for`).
- [ ] **Sharper animated clips (optional)** — the 6 animated WebPs (board-tiles, card-fronts,
      card-backs, race-3d-model, dice-tumbler, custom-cards) are sourced at ~480px and look
      soft on desktop. Re-export from higher-res recordings (720–1080p) if available.
- [ ] **Home "portfolio highlights" (3)** — still the older sibling-session shots
      (character-cards-in-jig, terrain-hexes-hero, miniatures-plate-hero); swap to newer/better
      ones for consistency (optional).
- [ ] **Real OG/social-share image** — currently a generated branded placeholder
      (`public/images/og-default.png`, `npm run og`); a real photo version would be nicer.
- [ ] **Home hero image or short video (optional, high-impact)** — the hero is text-only.
- [ ] **Retired UV-printer-screen photo** (`card-layout-artwork.webp`) — kept in repo, not shown;
      decide whether to place it (a "printing in progress" shot) or leave retired.

Data locations: portfolio items → `src/data/portfolio.ts` (`src`); services → `src/data/services.ts`
(`image`); card sub-pages → `src/data/cardCluster.ts` (`image`).

## 🧩 Beyond code — business / ops gaps (the stuff that isn't the site)

Asked "what else am I missing" (2026-07-15). The software is done; these are the non-code
things that actually gate running the business. Roughly by priority:

**Legal / money (do before invoicing real customers):**
- [ ] **Texas Sales & Use Tax permit** — invoices now show a flat 9% *service charge* (not an
      itemized tax), but if your sales are taxable you still must register with the TX Comptroller
      and remit sales tax. Relabeling doesn't remove the obligation.
- [ ] **Vercel plan** — the site is on the **Hobby** plan, which is for *non-commercial* use.
      A real business likely needs **Vercel Pro (~$20/mo)** to comply with their ToS (also
      lifts cron/limits). Verify + upgrade before/at launch.
- [ ] **Business payment accounts** — Zelle points to a *personal* email/phone and Venmo is
      `@kulworks`; Venmo for goods/services is supposed to use a **business profile** (personal
      use for business risks frozen funds). Consider a business bank account to separate money.
- [ ] **PayPal.me handle** — still `REPLACE_WITH_PAYPAL_ME_HANDLE` in `site.ts` (invoice pay link).
- [ ] **Business formation / DBA + insurance** — LLC vs. sole prop, DBA if "Kulworks" isn't
      your legal name, and general/product liability insurance. (Real-world, not the site.)
- [x] **Terms of Service page** — DONE. `/terms` (footer-linked) covering quotes/payment,
      artwork & IP rights, proofs/approval, custom-goods refunds, liability cap, Texas governing
      law. Solid template — worth an attorney's once-over before you rely on it.
- [ ] **PO box / mailing address** — required in newsletter footers (CAN-SPAM) before real sends.

**Get found / measure (post-launch):**
- [ ] **Google Business Profile** + reviews + local citations — the single biggest local lever
      (see the GBP section in LAUNCH-TODO.md). None of this exists yet.
- [ ] **Google Search Console** — verify `kulworks.com`, submit the sitemap.
- [ ] **Bing Webmaster Tools** — same.

**Deliverability / email:**
- [x] **DMARC record** — ALREADY IN PLACE (discovered 2026-07-15). A `_dmarc` TXT already
      exists at `p=none` (monitor), with reports going to Mailgun + OnDMARC. Do NOT add a second
      one (two DMARC records = both ignored). Later, tighten `p=none` → `quarantine` → `reject`
      once all legit senders confirm passing.
- [ ] **Confirm access to Mailgun + OnDMARC accounts** — inbound mail (MX) routes through
      **Mailgun** and SPF is `include:mailgun.org`; DMARC reports go to Mailgun/OnDMARC. You DO
      need inbound working (customer replies to contact@kulworks.com land there). Inbound-forwarding
      probe sent 2026-07-15 → if it reached your Gmail, forwarding works; still get the Mailgun
      login so you can manage/not lose it. Try mailgun.com sign-in with kulworksdesign@gmail.com.
- [x] **Spam-placement test** — test emails sent 2026-07-15 (placement + inbound) via Resend.
      Auth is in place (DKIM `resend._domainkey`, SPF, DMARC p=none). Sam to eyeball Gmail
      placement (inbox vs spam/promotions); re-run anytime by sending a real quote to yourself.

**Reliability / ops:**
- [x] **Error alerting** — DONE. `logError` now emails `QUOTE_NOTIFY_EMAIL` on new server errors,
      throttled to at most one every 15 min (`src/lib/log-error.ts`).
- [x] **Domain auto-renew** — confirmed ON by Sam (2026-07-15).
- [ ] **Rotate the Google refresh token** — during setup the live token was pasted into chat, so
      it's technically still "exposed." Re-run `npm run google:auth` once for a never-shared token,
      then update `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN` in `.env.local` + Vercel. Low urgency, needs Sam.
      *(Uptime monitoring: dropped per Sam 2026-07-15.)*

**On-site polish (code — small, in our control):**
- [x] **OG share image** — DONE (branded `og-default.png`, `npm run og`).
- [x] **Custom 404 page** — DONE (`src/app/not-found.tsx`, on-brand with links back).
- [x] **Security headers** — DONE (`next.config.mjs` sets HSTS, X-Frame-Options,
      X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy). CSP still deferred (needs
      nonces/hashes for the inline theme-init script + JSON-LD — a wrong CSP breaks the site).
- [ ] **Content-Security-Policy** — the one on-site item left: add a CSP with per-route
      nonces/hashes. Deferred because a wrong CSP silently breaks the theme + JSON-LD.
- [ ] **Image optimization** — `images.unoptimized: true`; logo PNG is oversized. Revisit for
      Core Web Vitals once real photos land.

## 🗄️ Custom backend build (the big project)

Goal: a custom database + password-protected admin dashboard, reachable from anywhere,
for tracking clients, querying data, and viewing analytics — all in one place.

- [x] **Pick the stack** — Supabase (all-in-one: Postgres + auth + file storage).
- [x] **Create Supabase project** — done (project "KulworksWebsite", region Canada Central).
- [x] **Supabase keys in local `.env.local` + Vercel** — done both sides.
- [x] **Free daily keep-alive** — covered: the daily reminders cron queries the DB every
      run, which resets Supabase's inactivity timer (no separate ping needed).
- [x] **Database schema** — Prisma models live in Supabase: Submission, Client, Profile
      (team/roles), Subscriber, PageView. Migration applied + connection verified.
- [x] **Client helpers** — Prisma singleton + Supabase browser/server auth clients.
- [x] **Wire the quote form to the DB** — `/api/quote` route saves submissions (upserts
      Client, creates Submission); form posts to it; honeypot + validation added; verified
      end-to-end. NOTE: this required switching next.config off static-export (`output:
      "export"`) to a server app — so the site must now deploy on Vercel (a server host),
      not a pure static host.
- [x] **Supabase env vars in Vercel** — 5 added (URL, PUBLISHABLE_KEY, SECRET_KEY,
      DATABASE_URL, DIRECT_URL).
- [x] **Email/cron env vars in Vercel** — all 5 added (RESEND_API_KEY, RESEND_FROM,
      QUOTE_NOTIFY_EMAIL, RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID, CRON_SECRET). All 10 env vars now in Vercel.
- [x] **Email notifications (Resend)** — DONE + verified. On submit: emails Sam the full
      quote (Reply-To = customer) AND sends the customer an auto-confirmation. Domain
      kulworks.com verified; consolidated to a single branded address `contact@kulworks.com`
      (from + reply-to + site). Sam set up Gmail send-as contact@ via Resend SMTP.
- [x] **Password-protected /admin dashboard** — email + password via Supabase Auth,
      server-side route guard (middleware), Profile bootstrap, owner/staff roles, multi-user
      ready. Login/logout built + verified. Create logins with `npm run admin:create`.
      (Still TODO: optional 2FA/MFA, rate-limited login, in-app "invite teammate" UI.)
- [x] **Mini CRM + BPM (read/browse)** — tabbed portal built: Dashboard (stats + upcoming
      due dates + recent submissions), Submissions, Projects, Clients. Each has expandable
      cards + grid view + search + CSV export. Activity log shown read-only in detail.
- [x] **Mini CRM + BPM (editing/mutations)** — DONE: convert Submission→Project, submission
      status change, project detail/edit page (all fields incl. stage/costs/dates/specs/
      shipping), client detail/edit page, add-project-for-client, add activity notes/logs.
      Via Next server actions (re-check auth). Demo data seeded (`npm run db:seed`, `--clean`
      to remove). Verified: build + edit round-trip.
- [x] **Payments** — itemized payments per project (amount + method: cash/card/PayPal/Venmo/
      Zelle/check/bank/other), with total paid + balance vs quote. Logged on project detail.
- [x] **Reminders (in-app)** — "set a reminder" (date + note) on projects/clients; auto-reminder
      created 3 days before a project's due date; Dashboard "Reminders" section shows
      open/overdue with mark-done. Dashboard upcoming + recent are now clickable.
- [x] **Idle auto-logout** — admin signs out after 30 min of inactivity.
- [x] **Reminders (notify me)** — DONE. `/api/cron/reminders` (secret-protected) emails Sam
      a daily digest of due/overdue reminders; `vercel.json` runs it daily at 13:00 UTC.
      (Cron only fires once deployed to Vercel.)
- [x] **Google Calendar integration** — SHIPPED + LIVE (2026-07-15). One-way push to a dedicated
      **Kulworks** calendar: project due + delivery dates and reminders (incl. the auto 3-day-before)
      sync as all-day events; edits/deletes in the app update/remove the same events (event ids
      stored on Project/Activity). Best-effort (never blocks a save). `lib/google-calendar.ts`,
      `scripts/google-calendar-setup.mjs`, `scripts/calendar-backfill.mjs`. OAuth setup done +
      verified live (26/26 e2e).
- [ ] **File storage for client artwork** — uploads instead of just a link/Drive checkbox.

## 📨 Newsletter / marketing email (also via Resend — no extra service)

- [x] **Newsletter signup form** — in the footer; posts to `/api/subscribe` (validate +
      honeypot). Verified.
- [x] **`subscribers` table + admin view** — signups stored in our DB (deduped); Subscribers
      admin tab with list + CSV export. Resend Audience sync comes with the sending phase.
- [x] **Send newsletters** — DONE. Subscribers auto-sync to a Resend Audience on signup;
      admin "Newsletter" tab composes + sends a Resend Broadcast (auto unsubscribe link).
      (Not live-fired yet — only demo subscribers exist. Add a physical mailing address
      to site data before real campaigns, for CAN-SPAM.)
- [ ] **Compliance** — Resend auto-adds unsubscribe links; marketing emails also need a
      physical mailing address (PO box OK) — ties to the empty address in site.ts.
- [ ] *(Later)* decide single vs double opt-in (default: single w/ clear consent).

### Newsletter v2 — extend in-house (Sam chose this 2026-07-02)
- [ ] **Subscriber tags/groups** + "send to group" selector (customer/prospect/interest).
- [ ] **Segmented sending** — Broadcasts only hit a whole Audience, so subset sends go via
      the email API to a filtered list + our OWN unsubscribe link + `/api/unsubscribe` handler.
- [ ] **Sent-newsletter log** in admin (track what went out, when, to whom).
- [ ] **Rich composer w/ images** — needs image hosting (Supabase Storage).
- [ ] **Pull open/click/bounce stats** from Resend API into the admin.
- [ ] **Optionally collect name/interest at signup** so there's data to segment on.
      (Age is impractical to collect; better levers: customer-vs-prospect, interest, location.)

## 📊 Page analytics (feeds the same DB + dashboard)

- [x] **Custom pageview tracker** — `/api/track` + cookieless `PageTracker` beacon (non-admin
      pages), logs path/referrer/geo/device/session; bots filtered. Verified.
- [x] **Analytics views in /admin** — Analytics tab: totals, unique visitors, 14-day bar,
      top pages, top referrers, devices, recent visits.
- [x] **Correlate visits with clients** — submission stores sessionId; submission detail shows
      "pages viewed before submitting."
- [ ] *(Optional)* Enable Vercel Web Analytics as a free accuracy backstop (one line).

## 🛡️ Hardening (added after smoke testing)

- [x] **Comprehensive smoke test** — `scripts/smoke-test.mjs` (npm-runnable via node): 21/21
      pass — every endpoint (valid/invalid/spam/auth), route guards, all DB mutations.
- [x] **Soft delete everywhere** — Submission/Project/Activity/Payment get `deletedAt`;
      "delete" archives (hidden from all views) and NEVER hard-deletes. All read queries
      filter `deletedAt: null`. (Future: an "Archived" view / restore.)
- [x] **Admin delete/archive buttons** — submissions, projects (+ cascade archive of its
      payments/activities), activities, payments — all with confirm dialogs.
- [x] **Newsletter send confirmation** — send now requires a confirm ("send to N?").
- [x] **Quote anti-flood** — same email within 60s is treated as a duplicate (protects DB +
      email quota).
- [x] **Admin error boundary** — friendly "try again" instead of a crash on transient errors.

## 🧭 Approved roadmap

**Tier 1 — before fully public (ALL SHIPPED ✅)**
- [x] **1. Admin password reset** — "Forgot password?" → Supabase reset email → /admin/reset. Live.
- [x] **2. Bot protection (Cloudflare Turnstile)** on /contact + newsletter. Live (real keys in Vercel).
- [x] **3. Privacy policy page** + footer link. Live at /privacy.
- [x] **4. Rate limiting** on /api/quote, /api/subscribe, /api/track (DB-based). Live.

**Tier 2 — high value (ALL SHIPPED ✅)**
- [x] **5. Artwork intake → Google Drive auto-folder** — creates + shares a Drive folder on
      request, emails the link, stores `driveFolderUrl` on the submission. Live.
- [x] **6. Archived / restore view** — /admin/archive lists soft-deleted items with restore. Live.
- [x] **7. Team invite UI + audit log** — invite-by-email + who-did-what audit log. Live.
- [x] **7b. Full admin management (Team page)** — add a team member (password now OR email
      invite, one merged form), edit email/role/phone, reset password, deactivate/reactivate
      (soft), change-my-password, 2FA. OWNER-only, audit-logged, guarded. Live.
- [x] **8a. Customer auto-confirmation on quote submit** — live.
- [x] **8b. Manual customer progress updates** — per-project "Send progress update" button
      (manual only) + one-click "Notify client: project started"; both logged with timestamps
      in the project's Activity timeline. Live.
- [x] **9. Error monitoring** — server errors captured to a DB ErrorLog, shown on the Team page. Live.

**Tier 3 — bigger**
- [x] **10. Quote & invoice generation** — SHIPPED. Line-item quotes/invoices in admin, a
      client-facing page at `/invoice/[token]`, and PayPal/Venmo/Zelle pay links (see
      `Invoice`/`InvoiceItem` models + `InvoiceEditor`). Only loose end: the PayPal.me handle
      placeholder in `site.ts` (listed under launch blockers).
- [ ] **11. Newsletter v2** — segmentation/tags, images, sent-log, open/click stats (scoped above).
- [x] **12. Google Calendar sync** — due/delivery dates + reminders → dedicated "Kulworks"
      calendar (one-way push). SHIPPED + LIVE (OAuth done, verified 26/26 e2e).
- [x] **13. Scheduled data backup/export** — weekly `/api/cron/backup` emails a JSON backup +
      on-demand download on the Team page. Live.

**Other later (not blocking launch)**
- [ ] **File uploads for client artwork** — in-form upload (today it's a Drive-folder link).
- [ ] *(Optional)* Vercel Web Analytics one-line backstop; single vs. double opt-in decision.

## 🧹 Housekeeping

- [x] **Committed + pushed** — all work on branch `feat/backend-crm` (Vercel preview built).
- [x] **Full site + app audit (2026-07-03)** — crawled every page (all 30 internal links
      resolve, 0 broken), verified every form's fields match its action, all API
      methods/validation/auth-gating correct, send/receive paths reviewed. Fixes shipped:
      the "Delete this project" button (missing hidden id — did nothing), misleading
      "permanent" delete copy (they're soft/restorable), an extra login redirect hop, and
      placeholder social icons no longer render as live (broken) links until real handles
      are set. Team add/invite merged into one form; one-click "Notify client: project
      started" added. 21/21 smoke.

## ✅ Done

- [x] Confirmed local copy is in sync with GitHub (nothing to pull).
- [x] Confirmed hosting: Vercel + GitHub (push = auto-deploy).
- [x] Decided direction: custom DB backend (not a form-only service or Google Form).
